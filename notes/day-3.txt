ILDASM: Intermediate Language Disassembler


1. OOP in C#:
class, access specifiers, 
members:
constructor, field, method, property

class access specifiers:
internal (by default) and public

member acess specifiers:
private (by default)

constructor:
special method to assign default or user data to the data members
its name has to be same as that of the class name
should not mention any return type with this method, as the constructor never returns anything
If you do not write any constructor explicitly inside the class, then the default constructor is supplied by default (in the IL code)
But, if you write any constructor explicitly inside the class, then the default constructor is NOT supplied by default (in the IL code)

optional argument with default value (4.0 -2010):
this argument should be the last one in the argument list
