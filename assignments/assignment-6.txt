calulate the area of different shapes: circle and triangle

Circle:
	data members: radius
	property: Radius
	ctor: default and parameterized
	methods: double CalculateArea()

Triangle:
	data members: tBase, tHeight
	properties: TBase, THeight
	ctor: default and parameterized
	methods: double CalculateArea()

create shapes in a library
create a console application which refers the library
create object of shapes based on user choice  (one each of every shape)
ask user to enter value for data members of the shape
store the references of all the shapes in an array 

iterate through the array 
calculate the area and display the same
