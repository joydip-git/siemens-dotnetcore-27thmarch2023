Step-1:
1. create console application, named, "CalculatorApp"
2. in the application, you need to create four more methods (apart from Main method) in Program class. all of them should be static method.

a. Add:
		arguments: int, int
		return type: int
		description: adds two numbers and returns the result

a. Subtract:
		arguments: int, int
		return type: int
		description: subtracts a number from another and returns the result

a. Divide
		arguments: int, int
		return type: int
		description: divide a number by another and returns the result

a. Multiply:
		arguments: int, int
		return type: int
		description: multiplies a number by another and returns the result

Note:
	all values should be accepted from user

Step-2:
	
1. create a separate library application, named, CalculationLibrary, in the same solution
2. move the 4 methods into that library class, which by the way, should be renamed to Calculation (class file should be renamed to Calculation also)
3. Build the library and add reference to this library from the console application
4. in the console app, use the namespace and access the Calculation class
Note: those 4 methods should no longer be static and should be declared with public access specifier
